# Francesco Grienti - A curiosity-driven Italian physicist, software developer and software engineer! 
## Hello there, coders and IT-passionates! 

I'm Francesco, an italian physicist who recently got passionate about IT and computer science related stuff (although I do not forget where I come from!).
In fact, my background resides in physics and I'm still on the way to become a second time physicist (I'm enrolled in _Physics of Data_ 
at the University of Milan). Since I've always been a curious person, various activities were able to get my attention letting me deeply dive 
into them, and in the last couple of years computer science, programming and IT technologies strongly hit me. 
I'm basically a real beginner and I still have a lot to learn, therefore suggestions and feedback are well-appreciated!
